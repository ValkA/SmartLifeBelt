# SmartLifeBelt
Moona hackathon 23.11.18, PubG team.

Our proposed system includes smart life belt which is dropped from a drone as soon as a drowning incident occurs.
The life belt has a small gas tank which inflates it as soon as it hits the water, that way it is minimally influenced by the wind while being dropped.

In our implementation we used an Android phone which gives the life belt a command to release the drone and wait the free falling time until inflation begins.
